CALORIE PREDICTION USING LINEAR REGRESSION:

This project marks my first hands-on experience with machine learning. I built a linear regression model to predict the number of calories burned during physical activity using a real-world dataset containing features like age, gender, weight, heart rate, and body temperature.

OBJECTIVES:

Predict calorie burn using linear regression.

Explore feature relationships and their impact on the target variable.

Practice end-to-end data science workflow from data cleaning to model evaluation.

TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES

Languages/Libraries: Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn

Techniques: Linear Regression, One-Hot Encoding, Feature Scaling, Train-Test Split, EDA


KEY STEPS

Loaded and cleaned the dataset (removed duplicates, handled missing values).

Performed exploratory data analysis to understand distributions and correlations.

Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables and standardized features.

Trained a linear regression model using scikit-learn.

Evaluated performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score.

Visualized model metrics and feature importance for interpretability.


RESULTS:

The model demonstrated a reasonable predictive performance.

Provided insights into which features most significantly influenced calorie burn.


What I Learned

This project helped me understand the foundational steps of a machine learning project: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. It solidified my confidence in using Python tools for real-world data problems and built the groundwork for more advanced models in the future.
